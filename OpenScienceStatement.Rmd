A statement on Open Science of up to 400 words, if possible including quantified or qualified statements about previous or ongoing open practices, or a statement of open philosophy for applicants who have not received the opportunity of working openly

Open science 
improves research outcomes through:
increases access - increasing spread of ideas
allows for replication and thus verification of results, 
makes researchers more efficient and better collaborators
builds community
science as service




Uncovering, verifying, sharing, and maintaining knowledge is made easier by open science. I have been fortunate to have had several mentors, Kaitlin Stack Whitney, Max Joesph, and Tim Mehaan, throughout my career who have pushed open science and demonstrated its value. In my current role as a Biosurveillance Scientist, I have pushed the National Biosurveillance Integration Center to adapt reproducible workflows using open source tools. 

During my graduate work at the University of Colorado-Boulder, I had a wonderful colleague named Max Joesph who pushed me to use open science practices. 

In undergrad - Dr. Tim Mehaan first introduced me to Moth Tools - a collection of python scripts used for landscape analysis
