A statement on Open Science of up to 400 words, if possible including quantified or qualified statements about previous or ongoing open practices, or a statement of open philosophy for applicants who have not received the opportunity of working openly

Open science 
improves research outcomes through:
increases access - increasing spread of ideas
allows for replication and thus verification of results, 
makes researchers more efficient and better collaborators
builds community
science as service


Everyday we see the world, but how we make sense of it depends on our context. Science seeks to understand the universe through rigorous testing and observation. Open science lays knowledge and process bare. It incentivises altruistic behaviors, fosters benevolent research communities, and increases access.     


I have been fortunate to have had several mentors, Kaitlin Stack Whitney, Max Joesph, and Tim Mehaan, throughout my career who have pushed open science and demonstrated its power to generate knowledge and a benevolent research culture. Kaitlin championed the recognition of research technician's work in lab publications and provided paid time to read the literature underlying the research we were conducting. Max created a safe space where his fellow graduate students could present their early explorations of a particular quantitative method or ask for support in a low pressure environment. Tim introduced me to the world of open data and open software while I was a research technician and I have never looked back.       

In my current role as a Biosurveillance Scientist, I have pushed the National Biosurveillance Integration Center to adapt reproducible workflows using open source tools and establish an open science culture. Not only do we produce higher quality work, we have created an environment that fosters intellectual and technical growth. 
-- how much you like teaching others and how much you learn from having to document and share code.      

Open science removes unnecessary barriers to research and improves research outcomes by ensuring those with the best ideas have access to data (where appropriate) and tools. 



During my graduate work at the University of Colorado-Boulder, I had a wonderful colleague named Max Joesph who pushed me to use open science practices.
